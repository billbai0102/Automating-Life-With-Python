# Automating Life With Python
### A collection of scripts I've created to automate my life using python.

## 1. EBay Price Tracker
This script will track eBay prices for you. Just enter in your email, app password, ideal price, and this app will send an email when 
the price has fallen to your desired price.</br>
<b>NOTE: </b> It is recommended that you run this on a Raspberry Pi and not your own computer since it will be calling the check method
every minute.
